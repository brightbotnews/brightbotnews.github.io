We read Breitbart so you don't have to!

Bright Bot News is a fun personal project to bring about absolutue hilarity. We summarize your favorite Alt-Right news in a digestable form inspired by Sumy the summarizer and tweetstorms.

I started this project based on @wearpants' suggestion over IRC. We bring to you nuggets of alternate wisdom from the erudites of our times.
